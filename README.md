# <Pre-work Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- The motivation to do this project came from the want to learn to code and jump into a career path that will help me down the road.
- This purpose behind this project was to create a starting point in my coding career, where I can apply what I learned about coding through the bootcamp pre-work.
- This project gives a place where I can store my pre-work notes along with having the (simple) functionability of being able to have the webpage tell me what to study.
- Through this project I was introduced to the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
